Kinematic Human Pose Estimation is used to track body postures using computer vision and image processing. Human pose estimation is the process of predicting the configuration of human body parts or joints (or a body pose) from images or videos. Pose tracking is a computer vision task that consists of detecting, associating, and tracking semantic keypoints (for examples  shoulders ,limbs ,wrist ,etc).

In this project, Kinematic Pose Estimation is used to monitor and track workouts. MediaPipe and OpenCV are fundamental libraries used to develop this project.
